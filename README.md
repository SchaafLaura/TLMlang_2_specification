## Specification
This is the (informal) specification for the programming language TLM2 (or TLMlang 2)
### General
TLM2 is based on TLMlang (Trans lives matter language) from May'24.
The '24 TLMlang is a stack-based, two-dimensional programming language focused on meta programming. Inspirations include Brainfuck, Befunge and cellular automata.

TLM2 is a complete rework of the original language, which include some of the old features (but not all) and many new. The source code for the simplest TLM2 program (which could be saved in a `.tlm` file to be interpreted) looks like this:
```
{main
.
}
```
Every TLM2 program has to contain a `main` function, where the instruction pointer starts at the top-left corner (the entry point), with the instruction-flow set to `(1, 0)`. In the above program the instruction pointer starts at the `.` (no-op) instruction, executes it, moves the instruction pointer one space to the right, which exits the function. The program then terminates. A little more advaced program could look like this
```
{main
11AB
}
```
As before, the instruction pointer starts on the leftmost instruction and moves to the right. The instructions executed are (in order)
* `1` - Push the number 1 to the stack
* `1` - Push the number 1 to the stack
* `A` - Pop the topmost two values (a and b) from the stack and push a+b (in this case 1+1=2) to the stack
* `B` - Pop the topmost value from the stack and write it to the output.

The program then, again, exits the main function on the right and the program halts.

A (functionally) identical program to the one above, which demonstrates the two-dimensional nature of the language is
```
{main
11D.
..A.
..B.
}
```
The only new instruction is `D` (down), which changes the instruction-flow from `(1, 0)` to `(0, 1)`. The instruction pointer starts moving downwards after executing it, executes the add and write instructions and then exits the main function on the bottom.

TLM2 is also able to modify its own source code, demonstrated with the following program
```
{main
1SL
}
```
After pushing 1 to the stack, the `S` instruction pops the topmost value off the stack and writes it in its stead into the source code. The body of the main function now looks like this `11L` and after getting redirected by the `L` (left) instruction, *two* 1s get pushed to the stack and the program exits the main function on the lefthand side.

### Control flow
Control flow always starts in the top left corner of the `main` function, moving to the right.

Control flow can be changed directly via the `U`, `D`, `L`, `R` (up, down, left, right) instructions and via the `O` (conditional redirect) instruction. The conditional redirect rotates the instruction-flow vector depending on the value on top of the stack. A value greater than 0 rotates the flow clockwise, less than 0 rotates counter-clockwise and a value of 0 leaves flow unaffected.

The following program goes in a loop forever
```
{main
R..D
....
U..L
}
```
The following program uses a counter to go in a loop 10 times, using the value on top of the stack as a counter. `1NA` pushes 1 to the stack, negates it, then adds the top two values on the stack - effectively a decrement operation. This will happen as long as the `O` instruction keeps redirecting control-flow downwards (and thereby back into the loop "body"). As soon as the value on top of the stack hits 0, control-flow at the `O` instruction will be unaffected and leave the main function to the right.
```
{main
55A.....R....1NA..O...
......................
........U.........L...
}
```

more things here???

### The stack
TLM2 is a stack based language and as such there are several operations that modify the stack in one way or another. The stack can be accessed from any function at any time. The stack contains integers only, however these integers might be interpreted as symbols by writing them to the output or by putting them into source-code via the meta-programming related instructions.

### Functions
Control flow can "leave" the main function by going to a different function. Function names are single lowercase letters (`a` through `z`). The instruction to enter a function is its name. When entering a function, the instruction pointer starts (as it does with the `main` function) at the top left corner and moves to the right.

The following program enters the function `f` twice - each time pushing the number 1 to the stack.
```
{main
ff
}
{f
1
}
```
Control flow is not preserved when exiting a function, so even if the body of the function of `f` was `1D`, the program would functionally be identical.

### Registers
TLM2, as opposed to TLM, has three (two?) registers to write to and read from; the x, y and z registers can be written to via the `X`, `Y` and `Z` instructions and can be read from via the `U`, `V` and `W` instructions respectively. Registers contain, as the stack, integers.

### Meta programming
yay

cool things here

### Ideas ?
* mark function as "clean" (does not modify its own source code in any way), could be very efficient to save its state (as it's just the instruction pointer position and flow) when going into other functions or doing recursion
* mark function as "persistant" (exiting it does not reset any source-code modification) (what about recursion?)
* increment and decrement can be implemented as `1A` and `1NA` respectively
* discard can be implemented with a simple function
```
{d
S
}
```
* more cool things
